- **Statistics and analytics**: Detailed statistics on ignored domains and error patterns
- **Command-line management tool**: Full CRUD operations via `manage_db.py`
- **Professional project structure**: Standard Python packaging with setup.py
- **Comprehensive documentation**: API docs, architecture overview, contributing guidelines
- **Unit test suite**: Automated testing with pytest
- **CI/CD pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow for testing and validation
- **Migration tools**: Script to migrate from old file-based format
- **Type hints**: Full type annotations for better code quality
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### Changed

- **Architecture**: Refactored to modular, plugin-based architecture
- **Logging**: All logs now in English with professional formatting
- **Comments**: All code comments converted to English
- **Configuration**: YAML-based logging configuration
- **Database schema**: Structured database with indexes and constraints

### Improved

- **Performance**: Database queries with proper indexing
- **Reliability**: Atomic transactions and proper error handling
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and modular design
- **Extensibility**: Plugin system allows easy addition of new features
- **Security**: Input validation and SQL injection prevention

### Technical Details

#### Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE ignore_hosts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    domain TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    origin TEXT NOT NULL,
    date_added TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_seen TEXT NOT NULL,
    count INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    active BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1
);
```

#### New Origin Types

- `existing_file`: Imported from existing ignore-host.txt
- `file_import`: Imported via CLI tool
- `tcp_tls_error`: TLS error detected in TCP layer
- `client_tls_error`: TLS error detected in client layer
- `manual`: Added manually via CLI
- `migration`: Added during system migration

#### New CLI Commands

- `list`: List domains with filtering options
- `add`: Add domains with origin tracking
- `remove`: Deactivate domains
- `search`: Search for specific domain information
- `stats`: Display database statistics
- `import/export`: Bulk operations for domain management

### Backward Compatibility

- Maintains compatibility with existing ignore-host.txt files
- Automatic import of existing domains during startup
- Continues to export to text file for compatibility

### Development Features

- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Automated testing with pytest
- Code quality checks with flake8
- Security scanning with bandit
- Coverage reporting
- Development dependencies management

### Documentation

- Comprehensive README with usage examples
- API documentation for all modules
- Architecture overview and design principles
- Contributing guidelines for developers
- Migration guide for existing users

This release represents a complete architectural overhaul while maintaining full backward compatibility and adding professional-grade features for production use.
