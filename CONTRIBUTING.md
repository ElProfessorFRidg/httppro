# Contributing to HttpPro

We love your input! We want to make contributing to HttpPro as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
